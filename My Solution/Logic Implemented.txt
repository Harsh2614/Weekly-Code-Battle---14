I had used PIL(Python Imaging Library), now known as Pillow 
for this challenge. It is a free & open source library available in 
python that is used for image related operations like opening,
manipulating pixels, draw text(watermarks), etc. It is done by 
taking width, height, margin of x & y coordinates in the image. 
PIL supports many different image file formats like jpeg, png,
etc. It is available for Windows, Linux & Mac OS. And most 
importantly, it supports python 3. The latest version right now 
available is PIL 1.1.7.

Steps Involved:-

1. Firstly we need to install pillow(PIL) if it is not in our by 
    default. For this, I used command as:-

    pip install pillow

2. Then we input image which we want to add the watermark.
     For this, I used Image.open('image path') & store it in some
     variable named input. 
 
     Note - Image is a pre-defined library in python in which we 
                 perform all our operations.

3. Next i set the width & height of image by assigning input.size
    to width & height vars as:-

    width, height = input.size

4. Then i draw the watermark(text) which we want to apply on
     image. For this, I used ImageDraw.Draw(input) & assign it
     to some var mark & then take the input of required text as 
     "Money Heist" as:-

     mark = ImageDraw.Draw(input)
     text = "Money Heist"

     Note - ImageDraw is a pre-defined library(module) in python 
                 & i use Draw method of this module.

5. Next i take the font of inputted text as default using 
    ImageFont.load_default() & then assign 
    draw.textsize(text, font) to some vars textwidth, textheight as:-

    font = ImageFont.load_default()
    textwidth, textheight = draw.textsize(text, font)

    Note - ImageFont is a pre-defined library(module) in python 
                 & i use load_default method of this module.

6. Now i set the margin of inputted as 10 & then set the x & y
    coordinates of text as:-

    x = width - textwidth - margin
    y = height - textheight - margin

7. At last, I apply the watermark in the bottom right corner of
    the image as present in 3rd gen smartphones as:-

    draw.text((x,y),text,font=font)

8. Now, i use the image show command to show the image as:-

     input.show()

9. Finally, I save the output i.e. watermarked image within the
    same directory as the inputted image as:-

    input.save('image path')
